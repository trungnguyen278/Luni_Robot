# Luni Robot Emotion Library v3.0 — Requirements

Canonical spec for the Luni screen-eye robot emotion library. Keep this
in sync with the code. When porting to another project, **read this file
first**.

Product: **Luni v3.0** — a desktop companion robot.

> Lineage: this library started life as "PTalk / MOCHI-P v2.0" (mono → 9-tone
> color, emotions + simple scenes). **v3.0 is the Luni rebrand.** The entry
> point is now `Luni Emotion Sheet.html`; the old `MOCHI-P Emotion Sheet.html`
> has been removed.

### What's new in v3.0

| Area               | Change |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Brand              | Renamed MOCHI-P → **Luni**. Single entry point `Luni Emotion Sheet.html`. |
| Third content kind | Added `kind: 'status'` (system chrome flows). `boot` and `network` moved from `scene` to `status` and get their own UI section. |
| Cinematic scenes   | Scenes are no longer multi-variant grids — each scene is **one continuous "scene-arc" mini-video** (eyes shrink to a corner, watch a prop, grow back). New shared engine `scene-arc.jsx`. See §6.6. |
| New emotions       | +10 categories: sick, cold, calm, playful, hot, lonely, grateful, brave, dreamy, awe. Now **47 emotion categories**. |
| New scenes         | +13 scene categories: alarm, notification, birthday, reminder, video, reading, smarthome, shopping, lock, delivery, flashlight, podcast, stopwatch. Now **32 scene categories**. |
| Connectivity       | `network` reworked to 7 variants incl. Bluetooth scan/paired (was a single BLE-pair). |
| Totals             | 81 categories · 238 variants (was 58 · 230). |

## 1. Project intent

An **original** robot character built around a 2-inch screen that shows
expressive eyes — and, when context calls for it, **full-screen scenes**
(weather, clock, music, timers, etc.). Implementation must be
independently designed — do not copy proprietary frames, transitions, or
distinctive marks from other products.

**No brand text appears inside the eye/scene SVG.** The viewer chrome
(HTML header, version badge) may identify the product as Luni v3.0 — it's
not part of the rendered display.

Personality: friendly, slightly mischievous, expressive.

The library has **three kinds** of content:

| Kind        | Purpose                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `emotion`   | Eyes-based expressions. Tied to dialog / mood.                     |
| `scene`     | Full-screen contextual mini-videos (weather/clock/music/timer…).   |
| `status`    | System chrome flows: power-on `boot` and connectivity `network`.   |

Every category has a `kind` field. The host can filter or pick from each
pool independently. The viewer (`app.jsx`) renders Emotions, Scenes, and
Status as three separate sections.

## 2. Hardware target

| Spec                | Value                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display             | 320 × 240, landscape, ~2 inch TFT (color)               |
| Reserved top strip  | 20 px (status bar: clock left, dot centre, wifi+battery right) |
| Active emotion area | 320 × 220 (y = 20 … 240)                                |
| Color mode          | RGB565 — 9-tone curated palette on near-black background |
| Frame rate          | **30 fps default** (range 12 – 60 acceptable)           |

Every pixel is restricted to one of a small **curated palette** of 9
emotional tones. See § 4.

## 3. Eye geometry

| Token   | Value | Notes                                                |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `EYE_W` | 88    | Each eye width                                       |
| `EYE_H` | 96    | Each eye height                                      |
| `EYE_RX`| 22    | Default corner radius                                |
| `GAP`   | 150   | Centre-to-centre between the two eyes                |
| `LX`    | 85    | Left eye centre X                                    |
| `RX`    | 235   | Right eye centre X                                   |
| `CY`    | 130   | Eye centre Y (mid of active area)                    |

All tokens live in `emotion-core.jsx` (`window.EmotionCore`).

---

## 4. Visual system — color

### 4.1 Palette

Defined in `emotion-core.jsx` as `EYE_TONES`. Each tone has an `eye` hex
and a matching glow rgba. All values are RGB565-safe.

| Tone     | Hex       | Used for                                          |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `cyan`   | `#5be9ff` | Default / neutral / robotic states. **Eyes always.** |
| `warm`   | `#ffd166` | Happy, smug, proud, excited, gold                 |
| `rose`   | `#ff6b9d` | Love, shy, embarrassed, playful, grateful, music  |
| `red`    | `#ff5b6e` | Angry, hot, brave, focused, determined, error, urgent |
| `blue`   | `#76b8ff` | Sad, crying, cold, lonely, rain, water            |
| `green`  | `#7be88e` | Charging, disgusted, sick, plant, fresh           |
| `purple` | `#b48cff` | Sleepy, sleeping, mischievous, suspicious, dreamy, dizzy |
| `orange` | `#ff9d5b` | Hungry, curious, confused, annoyed, nervous, fire |
| `white`  | `#f0f4ff` | Surprised, scared, awe, camera flash, snow        |

Background is always `--bg = #06090d` (near-black).

### 4.2 Color rules

The robot has a **face** that must stay readable across every emotion, so
we draw two layers:

| Layer       | CSS var       | Used for                                              | Color                                    |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Face        | `--eye`       | Eye rectangles, closed-eye arcs, brows, mouth          | **Always cyan** for every emotion variant |
| Accessory   | `--accent`    | Tears, hearts, sparkles, audio bars, mic, Zs, fire…    | The category's tone                       |
| Glow        | `--eye-glow`  | SVG drop-shadow filter on the screen                   | Cyan glow (emotions) / tone glow (scenes) |
| Background  | `--bg`        | Anywhere the screen "punches through" the eye          | Always `#06090d`                          |

For **scenes**, the eyes stay cyan (the robot's identity — see §6.6) while
the **prop** visuals take the scene's tone via `--eye`/`--accent`.

The **status bar** is system chrome — it ignores tones entirely and always
draws in fixed cyan (`#5be9ff`), for emotions, scenes, and status flows
alike.

### 4.3 Multi-color variants (`tone: 'multi'`)

A handful of variants need more than one color in the same frame (e.g.
`celebrate-grand` showers several colors). They set `tone: 'multi'`. The
Screen treats this as cyan for the base palette but **also exposes every
tone as a CSS variable** (`--tone-cyan`, `--tone-warm`, `--tone-rose`, …)
so the render function can paint specific colors:

```jsx
<rect fill="var(--tone-warm)" />
<circle fill="var(--tone-rose)" />
```

These extra CSS vars are only exposed when `kind === 'scene'`.

### 4.4 Per-variant / per-category tone

Resolution order:

```
variant.tone || category.tone || 'cyan'
```

Scenes set their tone at the category level (each scene now has a single
variant). The viewer resolves tone with `resolveTone(variant, cat)`.

### 4.5 Mono fallback

The viewer's **◐ Color / ◯ Mono** button forces every screen to render in
cyan, ignoring tones — useful for mono-display firmware ports and for
verifying nothing relies on color to be legible.

### 4.6 Misc

- Subtle CRT scanlines + glow applied as a CSS overlay.
- Smooth vector shapes (`rx` corners, arcs, `<path>`) — not pixel-art.
- Status bar font: monospace, ~11 pt at 1×. Centre slot is intentionally
  empty (a small dot or blank). Never tinted by category tone.

---

## 5. Animation rules

- Time `t ∈ [0, 1)` cycles every `duration` ms per variant.
- `t` is **quantized** to the chosen fps before render — produces the
  chunky "real robot display" feel.
- Default fps **30**. Renderer supports 12 – 60 fps with no code changes.
- Each variant declares its own `duration` (typical 0.6 – 5 s; scene arcs
  run longer, ~8 – 14 s).
- Each variant is a pure function `t ⇒ SVG JSX` — no internal state.

---

## 6. Conceptual model — "normal" vs "idle"

The category called **`normal`** is the *default look* of the robot — a
set of variants the host picks from when nothing else is happening.

**Idle is a behaviour, not a category.** Firmware "idle" should:

1. Stay on category `normal`.
2. Every N seconds (recommend 3 – 6 s), call `pickVariant('normal',
   recentIds)` and play the result.
3. Keep a 4 – 6-entry ring buffer of recent ids so the same variant
   doesn't repeat back-to-back.

The viewer (`app.jsx`) implements this in the **"◉ Idle mode"** button.

## 6.5 Boot & connectivity flow (`kind: 'status'`)

Firmware uses two `status` categories — `boot` and `network` — to drive
the entire startup-to-conversation pipeline. Both **block** the normal
emotion loop while playing; the host suspends autoplay until the flow
exits.

### 6.5.1 Cold boot sequence (4 stages, brand-clean cyan)

```
  POWER ON
     ↓
  boot-poweron           — dot expands, splits into two eyes
     ↓
  boot-credits           — monogram + name typewriter + role line
     ↓
  boot-checks-personal   — DISPLAY / AUDIO / MIC / NETWORK / AI CORE self-test
     ↓
  → [ connectivity sub-flow §6.5.2 ] →
     ↓
  boot-ready-personal    — progress 0→100% + "READY" stamp
     ↓
  HAND OFF to `normal` idle pool
```

No school/company branding appears on screen at any stage.

### 6.5.2 Connectivity sub-flow (`network`, 7 variants)

`network-wifi-scan` (cyan) · `network-wifi-connect` (cyan) ·
`network-wifi-retry` (orange) · `network-offline` (red) ·
`network-bt-scan` (purple) · `network-bt-paired` (purple) ·
`network-server-error` (red)

```
  poweron complete
     ↓
  network-wifi-scan  (no stored SSID)  →  network-bt-scan / network-bt-paired
     ↓ SSID known                          (user holds pair button; phone app
  network-wifi-connect                      pushes credentials → wifi-connect)
     ↓ fail (up to 3 attempts)
  network-wifi-retry  →  network-offline (red; retry every 60 s)
     ↓ wifi up
  (ping cloud /health)
     ↓ reachable                  ↓ unreachable
  hand off to boot-ready        network-server-error (backoff 2/5/10/30 s)
```

While any `network-*` scene plays, the host suppresses user-facing
emotions — these are blocking status displays.

### 6.5.3 Mid-session network loss

1. **TCP/WebSocket drop while talking**: freeze the current emotion frame
   (not idle pool), show `network-server-error` for up to 5 s of fast
   retries; on reconnect fade back, else drop to `network-offline`.
2. **Wi-Fi link drop**: skip server-error; go straight to
   `network-offline` until link returns, then `network-wifi-connect`.
3. **Long offline (≥30 s)**: optionally play the `error-noconn` emotion
   once to acknowledge.

## 6.6 Scene-arc model (`kind: 'scene'`)

In v3 every scene is a **continuous mini-video** rather than a static
display. Luni's eyes stay visible the WHOLE time — they shrink and move to
a corner to "watch" the prop, then grow back when the prop leaves. The
shared engine is `scene-arc.jsx` (`window.SceneArc`):

```
  OPEN          TRANS-IN       ACT            TRANS-OUT      CLOSE
  big eyes,     eyes shrink    prop owns      prop leaves /  big eyes,
  centered,     to corner,     screen; eyes   eyes grow      centered,
  opening emo   prop enters    watch          back           closing emo
```

`sceneArc(t, opts?)` returns `{ phase, p, eyeScale, eyeCx, eyeCy, sceneOp,
emotion }`. `LuniFace` / `TransformedFace` render the eyes (always cyan —
switching shape, not color, avoids a distracting mid-scene flash). The
scene's tone colors the **prop** visuals only.

Each scene category therefore has exactly **one** variant — the arc.
(Exception: multi-case scenes, §6.7.)

## 6.7 Multi-case scenes (state that varies with the real world)

Some scenes don't depict a one-off event — they depict a **state of the
world that can be different each time**. `weather` is the canonical
example: the host must show the *actual* sky, not always "sunny". So a
handful of scene categories carry **more than one variant**, one per
state. Each case is authored as its own self-contained mini-story —
distinct props, motion, tone, eye-emotion arc and caption — so no two
cases of the same scene look or read alike.

| Scene     | Cases | Variants                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `weather` | 7     | sunny (`weather-window`) · cloudy · rainy · storm · snow · fog · windy                          |
| `moon`    | 8     | trăng non/Sóc · lưỡi liềm đầu · thượng huyền · khuyết đầu · Rằm · khuyết cuối · hạ huyền · liềm tàn |
| `call`    | 3     | incoming · outgoing · missed                                                                  |
| `message` | 3     | chat · incoming · sent                                                                        |

**Tone is per-variant here** (`variant.tone` overrides `category.tone`):
rainy is blue, storm purple, snow white, a missed call red, etc. The
viewer already resolves this via `resolveTone(variant, cat)`.

**Host picks the case explicitly.** These do NOT enter the random idle
pool. The firmware chooses the variant matching the live condition, e.g.:

```js
function showWeather(condition) {            // condition: 'rain' | 'snow' | ...
  const map = {
    clear: 'weather-window', sunny: 'weather-window',
    cloudy: 'weather-cloudy', rain: 'weather-rainy',
    storm: 'weather-storm', thunder: 'weather-storm',
    snow: 'weather-snow', fog: 'weather-fog', wind: 'weather-windy',
  };
  const id = map[condition] || 'weather-window';
  const v = EMOTION_CATEGORIES.weather.variants.find(x => x.id === id);
  play(v);
}
```

Falls back to the first variant (sunny / incoming / chat) for an unknown
state. Adding a new case = push another variant onto the category's
`variants` array; nothing else changes (no new category, so the
authoritative KEYS order in `scenes-arc-pack-3b.jsx` is untouched).

**`moon` — the lunar multi-case scene.** Luni *is* the moon, so the month
is a first-class state. `scenes-moon.jsx` adds a `moon` category where
**Luni's own body is the moon**. Per the identity rule (eyes are Luni),
each phase story **opens and closes on the signature cyan eyes**: the
canonical centered pair shows first, the moon disc then *materializes
around those same eyes* (they draw together and shrink onto the disc), the
story plays, the disc dissolves, and the eyes return to their signature
pose. Each phase is its own long vignette (≥22s) with a distinct mood:

  Sóc (mùng 1) ngủ say (sao băng vụt qua) → lưỡi liềm bừng tỉnh → thượng
  huyền leo dốc trời → khuyết đầu háo hức (đèn lồng thắp dần) → **RẰM**
  tròn đầy an nhiên (mắt hiền, quầng sáng dịu, đèn lồng bay) → khuyết cuối
  mãn nguyện → hạ huyền ngáp dài → liềm tàn về nghỉ → vòng về Sóc.

The phone app conveys phase only by how brightly it draws the moon glyph;
on the TFT that reads nearly the same every night, so each phase here is
its own vignette (lit fraction + face mood + props + beat). The host
picks tonight's story by lunar date via `window.LuniMoon`:

```js
showScene('moon', LuniMoon.sceneId());            // tonight's ngày âm lịch
showScene('moon', LuniMoon.sceneForLunarDay(15)); // a specific âm lịch day (Rằm)
```

The 30 lunar days fold onto the 8 phase stories (nearest canonical phase).

### Scenes (kind: 'scene') — 32 categories · 42 variants

Most scenes are a single continuous arc (§6.6). A few represent a
**real-world state that varies**, so they carry one distinct case per
state (see §6.7) — the host passes which case to play. Tone in `()`.

**Multi-case scenes** (each case is its own mini-story, no two alike):

| Category   | Cases | Variant ids (tone)                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `weather`  | **7** | `weather-window` sunny (warm) · `weather-cloudy` (cyan) · `weather-rainy` (blue) · `weather-storm` (purple) · `weather-snow` (white) · `weather-fog` (blue) · `weather-windy` (cyan) |
| `call`     | **3** | `call-incoming` (green) · `call-outgoing` (green) · `call-missed` (red)                                                              |
| `message`  | **3** | `message-chat` (cyan) · `message-incoming` (cyan) · `message-sent` (rose)                                                            |

All remaining scenes have a single arc variant:

### Variant contract

```js
{
  id: 'normal-look',        // unique kebab-case across the whole library
  label: 'Look around',     // human label
  duration: 4000,           // ms per loop
  tone: 'warm',             // (optional) overrides category.tone; 'multi' for
                            //   variants wanting every tone as --tone-* vars
  render: (t) => /* JSX */, // pure function of t ∈ [0, 1)
}
```

Variants in the same category must be **visually distinct**.

### Architecture note — who owns what

Each category lives in exactly one place now:

- **Emotions** — `emotion-list` / `emotion-extras` / `emotion-balance` /
  `emotion-more` / the three `emotion-pack-luni*` files. Tones come from
  `emotion-color.jsx` (or inline on the Luni-pack cats).
- **Status** (`boot`, `network`) — `scenes-boot.jsx` / `scenes-network.jsx`;
  tones from `emotion-color.jsx`.
- **Scenes** — authored *only* by the four `scenes-arc-pack-*` files, each
  as a single cinematic arc with its tone set inline. No scene render code
  is duplicated anywhere else.

`scenes.jsx` is now just the one-line side-effect that tags pre-existing
categories as `kind:'emotion'` (the scene/status packs set their own kind).

**Key order is centralised.** Intermediate files still splice their keys
into `EMOTION_CATEGORY_KEYS`, but the **authoritative order** is the final
block at the end of `scenes-arc-pack-3b.jsx` — one explicit list of every
category, filtered to those that exist (orphans appended at the end). To
reorder or add a category, edit that list. Final grouping: emotions, then
status (`boot`, `network`), then scenes.

---

## 9. Random-picker reference (firmware side)

```js
function pickVariant(categoryKey, recentIds) {
  const cat = EMOTION_CATEGORIES[categoryKey];
  const pool = cat.variants.filter(v => !recentIds.includes(v.id));
  const choices = pool.length ? pool : cat.variants;
  return choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];
}

// Filter by kind:
const emotionKeys = EMOTION_CATEGORY_KEYS
  .filter(k => !EMOTION_CATEGORIES[k].kind || EMOTION_CATEGORIES[k].kind === 'emotion');
const sceneKeys  = EMOTION_CATEGORY_KEYS.filter(k => EMOTION_CATEGORIES[k].kind === 'scene');
const statusKeys = EMOTION_CATEGORY_KEYS.filter(k => EMOTION_CATEGORIES[k].kind === 'status');

// Idle loop (firmware default behaviour):
function tickIdle(state) {
  const v = pickVariant('normal', state.recent);
  state.recent = [...state.recent, v.id].slice(-6);
  play(v);
  schedule(tickIdle, 3000 + Math.random() * 3000); // 3–6 s
}

// Resolving color for any variant:
function toneFor(cat, variant) {
  return variant.tone || cat.tone || 'cyan';
}
```

**Scenes and status flows are picked explicitly** by the host — they don't
enter the random idle pool. Use scenes when there is something to show
(`showScene('weather')`); use status flows for boot / connectivity.

---

## 10. Porting checklist

1. Copy every `*.jsx` file under § 8 + `REQUIREMENTS.md`. Mind the load
   order — color assignment and arc overrides depend on every category
   being registered first.
2. Replace the SVG primitives in `emotion-core.jsx` (`Eye`, `Eyes`,
   `heartPath`, `starPath`, `arcPath`) and the `scene-arc.jsx` engine with
   your renderer's native draw calls. Renderer is called once per frame
   with quantized `t`.
3. Build a color LUT keyed by tone name (`EYE_TONES`). At draw time resolve
   the active tone with `variant.tone || cat.tone || 'cyan'`.
4. **Honor the two-layer color rule (§ 4.2):** cyan for face shapes, the
   resolved tone for accessories / scene props. Status bar always cyan.
5. For `tone: 'multi'` variants, expose every tone as a named slot.
6. Implement `pickVariant` (§ 9) with a per-category recent ring buffer
   (length 4 – 6) and an idle scheduler that picks `normal` every 3 – 6 s.
7. Implement `showScene(catKey)` and the boot/network status FSMs (§ 6.5).
8. Honour the geometry: `W=320`, `H=240`, `STATUS_H=20`, `LX=85`, `RX=235`,
   `EYE_W=88`, `EYE_H=96`, `GAP=150`.

---

## 11. Design constraints worth keeping

- Eyes fill the screen generously — outer margin only ~41 px each side.
- One visual language across all variants: same eye-shape vocabulary,
  stroke weights, and accessory style (dots, arcs, stars, hearts, Zs).
- In scenes, eyes never disappear — they shrink to a corner and watch.
- Status bar always visible during playback; always fixed cyan.
- Face shapes (eyes, mouth, brows) are fixed cyan across every emotion —
  the category's tone only colors accessories / props.
- No emoji. No raster images. SVG only.
- One bright accent color per frame (except `tone: 'multi'`).

---

## 12. Out of scope (future)

- Sprite-sheet PNG / GIF export per variant.
- Inter-emotion transitions (e.g. `listening → thinking` smooth blend).
- Tweaks panel for eye color / shape / personality preset.
- 16-color palette per scene (currently 9 tones).
